        "ANS - The yield statement suspends function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list"

        "1. List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map.  \n",
        "2. List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility. For example, to print all odd numbers in range of 50, we can write [n for n in range(50) if n%2 != 0]. There is no alternate for it in map.  \n",
        "3. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as final output.but map only returns a map object. it needs to be explicitly coverted to desired datatype.  \n",
        "4. List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express  \n",
        "5. Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function on a set of values."
